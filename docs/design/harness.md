# AgentHarness

`AgentHarness` owns agent execution. It receives a task instruction, model
configuration, and temporary bridge connection details, then starts the agent,
runs it within the configured deadline, and stops it positively before bridge
revocation or evaluation can proceed.

## Boundary and lifecycle

The harness does not own the benchmark task container, verifier material,
bridge listener, or evaluation. It may retain its own logs, telemetry, and
rendered configuration as private run artifacts. Model credentials are supplied
at runtime and must not be written into profiles, structured logs, Docker
metadata, or results.

The current implementation is OpenClaw in a pinned container image. ARIES starts
the harness only after the sandbox and bridge are ready. On success, failure, or
cancellation, it stops the harness and confirms absence. Evaluation remains a
separate Benchmark outcome rather than an interpretation of harness success.

A task may withhold the harness's own tools that act in the sandbox: when
`core.Task.NoSandboxTools` is set, the runner passes it in the
`HarnessRequest`, and the harness renders none of its shell, code-execution or
file tools (Hermes leaves `terminal`, `file` and `code_execution` out of
`platform_toolsets` and disables them; OpenClaw also denies `exec` and
`process`). The agent then acts through its MCP servers and the harness's web
tools only. A benchmark whose tasks list their own tools sets it to keep to
that list (Toolathlon); every other task keeps all of the harness's tools.

OpenClaw container lifecycle, gateway protocol, and voice-session semantics are
separate concrete responsibilities. `openclaw.Manager` owns the container and
publishes one ephemeral host-loopback port. `openclaw/gateway.Client` owns one
authenticated WebSocket protocol connection and bounded fail-closed frame
dispatch. `openclaw/realtime.Runner` consumes that client for talk/chat/tool
session semantics; the gateway package intentionally contains no voice event
parsers or Docker lifecycle.

Text, realtime and voice-transcribe modes share the authenticated Gateway transport. Text sends exactly one pinned-version `agent` request and correlates accepted and terminal responses by both frame request ID and non-empty run ID; an ambiguous send, disconnect, timeout, or protocol mismatch is never retried. Realtime and voice-transcribe require read and write scopes, while text requires write scope. Only sanitized role and
sorted scope metadata may leave the authentication boundary.

Realtime and voice-transcribe both convert the task instruction to staged audio and stream it through an authenticated OpenClaw Gateway Talk session. Realtime owns one `realtime` talk session and may invoke nested agent runs through the same authenticated client. Voice-transcribe owns one `transcription` session only for streaming speech recognition. After the final transcript is accepted, ARIES closes that realtime gateway connection and opens a response-only gateway connection with agent write scope for the OpenClaw agent request. Their audio, transcript, result, and optional event records remain private harness artifacts. The separate realtime/TTS credential is staged privately for voice mode and is not part of model configuration, Gateway authentication, or structured results. All modes remain concrete behavior of the single`AgentHarness` role; realtime does not create a fifth Runner role or take ownership from the benchmark, sandbox, or bridge.

OpenClaw `voice-transcribe` deliberately separates speech recognition from agent execution. Once the final transcript is received, it closes the transcription session, then invokes the agent with the transcript as a normal text input. This preserves the standard text-mode agent behavior while still using OpenClaw's streaming speech recognition path.

## Hermes

Hermes is the second supported harness and runs the pinned upstream image
unmodified. It supports text and voice-transcribe modes; `harness.mode: "realtime"` remains OpenClaw's.

`hermes.Manager` owns one container held at an idle command, so ARIES decides
when the agent starts rather than the image entrypoint. One task instruction is
delivered by executing a staged wrapper that runs the Hermes one-shot
(`hermes --ignore-rules --yolo --model … --provider … -z …`) and reports its
status through a delimited exit trailer. The instruction is passed as a single
argument vector element, never interpolated into a shell string. `--toolsets` is
deliberately not passed: on the pinned version its validator can return a bare
`None` that the caller unpacks, so the agent would exit before doing any work.
Toolsets come from the rendered configuration instead.

In voice-transcribe mode, unlike OpenClaw, Hermes exposes no realtime gateway session. It synthesizes the task prompt into audio, sends the whole recording to the configured Hermes ASR provider, stores the transcript, and then starts the same Hermes one-shot agent flow with the transcript as the text instruction.

Hermes exposes no control protocol, so there is no gateway client. The final
response is the one-shot's standard output, and the message-level trajectory is
Hermes's own SQLite session store exported to standard output. Container logs,
both output streams, the redacted configuration, and the session export are
private harness artifacts.

Hermes reads its SSH target from environment variables, so ARIES sets
`TERMINAL_ENV=ssh` with the bridge's host, port, user, and identity path; this
is upstream's native SSH environment, not an ARIES modification. The working
directory is the sandbox workdir the bridge reports on its endpoint, the
directory every agent command runs in. Hermes prefixes each command with
`builtin cd -- <dir> || exit 126`, so ARIES names that directory both in
`TERMINAL_CWD` and in a `terminal:` section of the rendered configuration
(backend, directory, timeout): without that section the v2026.5.29.2 CLI
replaces `TERMINAL_CWD` with its own process directory. `HERMES_HOME`
is relocated to a staged private directory so the image's declared `/opt/data`
volume holds no run state; that one anonymous volume is still created by Docker
and is the only mount the harness tolerates. The model credential is written to
the rendered configuration as a `${NAME}` reference, staged separately as a
private key file, and exported by the wrapper inside the container, so no
credential value reaches the configuration, Docker metadata, or results.

Two upstream details are load-bearing. First, `/opt/hermes/bin/hermes` sits
earliest on `PATH` and is a privilege-drop shim: invoked as root it re-execs the
real binary as the image's unprivileged `hermes` user. Everything ARIES stages
is therefore owned by that user, asserted by the container's own start command
because the Engine's copy API resets archive ownership to root. Staging as root
instead leaves the agent unable to read its own configuration, and the failure
surfaces far from its cause. The readiness probe runs `hermes --version` rather
than only stat-ing the staged files, because those checks run as root and pass
regardless of ownership.

Second, Hermes requires `/bin/bash` in the task image, because every tool call
it issues is `bash -c` on the remote.

Third, Hermes accepts only provider names in its own registry, and the one-shot
rejects an unknown name before any request. Neither pinned version knows
`sglang` or a plain `openai` provider, so the renderer maps both backends to
Hermes's generic `custom` provider, which routes to `model.base_url`, in the
rendered config and in the one-shot's `--provider` argument. DeepSeek is a
built-in provider and stays as written.

Fourth, three optional profile blocks render into `config.yaml` only when set:
`model.context_length` / `max_tokens` / `temperature`, `harness.compaction`,
and `harness.hermes.extra_body`. Compaction is a general harness capability and
stays on the shared `harness` block; `extra_body` is a Hermes escape hatch, so
it lives under the type-specific `harness.hermes` block. It is a non-empty JSON
object written as the `extra_body` of one `custom_providers` entry, which
Hermes merges into every chat request for its `custom` provider. Explicit
`model.temperature`, including zero, uses this same request path on `sglang`
and `openai`; the pinned one-shot ignores the model YAML temperature field.
Native DeepSeek temperature and duplicate temperature settings in the profile
and extra body are rejected. Hermes expands
`${NAME}` references in its configuration from the process environment, so the
harness exports `ARIES_RUN_ID` and `ARIES_TASK_ID` into the container and a
profile can tag every request with the task; a profile may reference only those
two, which keeps the credential reference out of request bodies. The profile
loader also rejects any field, at any depth, named like a credential, so a
literal key cannot reach the retained `config.yaml` or the request bodies. The `v2026.8.31` image also sets
`HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT=/opt/data`, which makes `write_file` and `patch` refuse
every sandbox path; the harness clears it, because the sandbox is the isolation
boundary and the tools act on it over SSH.

## Customization & Contribution Guide

Add a harness only when it can implement the existing `AgentHarness` lifecycle
without taking ownership from the other roles. Keep the implementation in a
concrete harness package with an explicit constructor, add its explicit switch
to the command wiring, and provide focused tests for start, run, cancellation,
idempotent stop, positive absence, credential handling, and artifacts. Update
the supported reference and this guide with evidenced behavior; do not add a
registration, discovery, factory, reflection, DI, or generic plugin layer.

## Model Context Protocol (`MCP`)

ARIES supports configuring Model Context Protocol (`MCP`) servers for agent harnesses via `harness.mcp_servers`.

`core.MCPServerConfig` defines the server configuration (name, command/`args` for `stdio`, or `url` for `SSE`/`HTTP`). A `url` server may name its `transport` (`sse` or `streamable-http`; empty keeps the harness's default, which differs between harnesses) and any server a per-call `timeout_seconds` (zero keeps the harness's default). Configuration validation is enforced by `core.ValidateMCPServer`:
- Server names must not contain `whitespace` or control characters.
- Either an executable command or an absolute `HTTP`/`HTTPS` `url` must be specified, never both.
- Environment variable mappings are split into benign plain text (`env`) and host credentials (`secret_env`):
  - `env` maps target variables to plain text values that do not contain control characters.
  - `secret_env` maps target variables to host environment variable names. Raw secrets are rejected at validation time; rendered configurations persist `${NAME}` placeholders, and harness session startup stages credentials into private key files (`0600`) exported by in-container launcher scripts rather than exposing them in container environment metadata.
  - Both `env` and `secret_env` are supported for command servers and rejected for `url` servers.
- `transport` applies only to `url` servers; `timeout_seconds` must not be negative.

Each harness scrubs the `secret_env` values from everything it saves (session exports, logs, the retained config) together with its own keys. A harness's `RedactEnv` option names further host variables whose values the harness is never given but scrubs the same way: a benchmark's credentials that reach the sandbox, where the agent can read them (wiring fills it from Toolathlon's `credentials_env` and `credential_files_env`). A multi-line or `JSON` value is scrubbed by its lines and string fields as well (`core.SecretParts`).

Harnesses manage `MCP` execution and network boundaries as follows:
- **Command servers (`stdio`)** execute directly inside the agent container environment.
- **`URL` servers (`HTTP`/`SSE`)** connect over the network to remote endpoints rather than running inside the local container.
- **OpenClaw**: Configures `MCP` servers in the rendered `openclaw.json` under `mcp.servers`. In `sandboxed` execution, `MCP` tool access is gated by appending `"bundle-mcp"` to `tools.sandbox.tools.alsoAllow`.
- **Hermes**: Renders configured `MCP` servers into `config.yaml` under `mcp_servers`, enabling in-container agent discovery and invocation.

Tool invocation and communication remain entirely within the agent container boundary.
