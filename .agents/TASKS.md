# ARIES Tasks

## PR #51 — Effective Hermes temperature

- Confirmed the pinned one-shot ignores model YAML temperature. Route explicit
  profile temperature through custom-provider request extra_body, preserving
  zero and existing JSON number precision. Reject duplicate temperature sources
  and unsupported native DeepSeek temperature before setup and rendering.
- Retained the reviewed Hermes-specific extra_body block and credential checks;
  shared model and compaction data remain unchanged for future harness support.
- Regression-first unit checks and a real pinned v2026.8.31 one-shot HTTP test
  reproduced the defect, then passed for zero and 0.7 with unrelated request
  fields preserved. Independent diff review found no blocking issue.
- The same real one-shot now covers legacy v2026.5.29.2 and confirms its
  request path accepts the explicit context length and sends max tokens,
  temperature, and custom extra-body data. Source inspection confirms that
  release ignores only the new absolute `compression.threshold_tokens` cap.
- Build, unit, race, lint, and every integration package except the unchanged
  SWE-bench Pro LFS fixture pass. That environment gap is recorded under PR #50.
  SDK inspection confirms zero ARIES containers/networks; diff and key scans pass.

## PR #50 — External SGLang review correction

- Removed the native launch-file requirement from external SGLang profile
  validation and preparation; retained managed configuration and external
  ownership checks. Existing optional external file references remain accepted
  but are not opened. Added decode and no-side-effect preparation regressions.
- Build, unit, race, and lint checks pass. All integration packages except
  SWE-bench Pro pass. That fixture initially lacked Git LFS; an ignored local
  official Git LFS installation still leaves the pinned Parquet as an LFS
  pointer, so the dataset integration remains an explicit environment gap.
- Final Docker inspection found no ARIES containers or networks.
## R23 — Toolathlon benchmark adapter

1. [x] Pin the Toolathlon checkout, install it atomically, and materialize the
   two gitignored site configs its scripts import unconditionally.
2. [x] Map task directories to benchmark-neutral tasks, and refuse at load every
   task whose MCP servers need a third-party account or the k8s host runtime.
3. [x] Before bridge access, install the pinned project tree, start a loopback
   forwarder for Toolathlon's fixed application ports, run Toolathlon's own
   preprocess, validate the task bundle it writes, stash the grader and ground
   truth to the private run directory and prove them absent, then start the
   MCP gateway and wait for its health endpoint.
4. [x] Render Hermes's `mcp_servers` block from a new `harness.mcp.servers`
   profile block, so the harness reaches the gateway at the sandbox's fixed
   network alias.
5. [x] After harness stop and bridge revocation, discard agent-planted grader
   paths, restore the stash, re-inject the trusted bundle, run Toolathlon's
   evaluator, and score from its verdict file.
6. [x] Add strict configuration/version decoding, explicit command wiring, a
   one-task profile, package regressions with a scripted-sandbox flow test,
   and public documentation.

Completion evidence:

- `make lint`, `make build`, and `go test ./...` pass; `aries setup` installs
  the pinned checkout and verifies it clean.
- `canvas-list-test` ran end to end against DeepSeek: preprocess seeded Canvas
  through the forwarder, Hermes made 55 tool calls (30 through the gateway, 25
  through the SSH bridge), both isolation gates were confirmed, the grader ran,
  and cleanup left no container or network behind. The verdict was a fail by
  one row — the grader's judgement of the agent, not a pipeline fault.
- Running the first profile exposed a stale DeepSeek model list in preflight
  (the API now serves `deepseek-flash`); fixed in a separate commit.
- `make test-race` passes. `make integration` passes once the Terminal-Bench 2
  checkout the OpenClaw integration test expects is installed (`aries setup`
  with a TB2 profile); it is an environment prerequisite, not a code change.
  Final Docker inspection found no ARIES containers or networks.

## R22 — Public SWE-bench Pro benchmark adapter

1. [x] Pin the public dataset and official open-source evaluator independently,
   install them atomically with Git LFS resolution, and strictly validate all
   731 public rows plus their task-specific evaluator files.
2. [x] Map selected rows to benchmark-neutral tasks and row-provided tagged
   images while keeping gold patches, verifier tests, gold revisions, and test
   expectations out of `core.Task`.
3. [x] Before bridge access, capture private verifier and initial ignored-build
   snapshots, restore the base worktree, remove local remotes/future refs and
   unreachable gold history, and positively prove the sanitized state.
4. [x] After harness stop and bridge revocation, capture the candidate patch,
   restore the fresh-image baseline, inject only the pinned verifier inputs,
   and score all `FAIL_TO_PASS` plus `PASS_TO_PASS` expectations.
5. [x] Add strict configuration/version decoding, explicit command wiring, a
   one-task profile, package regressions, real pinned-source integration
   coverage for all 731 tasks, and public/internal documentation.
6. [x] Complete focused, race, full release, Docker-backed gold-patch, cleanup,
   secret, and final diff validation; record any environment gap before the
   standalone commit.

Completion evidence:

- The exact pinned dataset and evaluator load all 731 public tasks; schema, task
  order, image tags, prompt construction, selector/file separation, and private
  state validation pass against the real upstream artifacts.
- A pinned qutebrowser image resolves with the dataset gold patch and remains
  unresolved with an empty patch. The same E2E leaves a background agent-owned
  process before evaluation, proving the UID quiescence gate and container
  cleanup on both outcomes.
- Focused and race tests, `make build`, `make test`, `make test-race`,
  `make lint`, `make integration`, `go mod verify`, and `git diff --check` pass.
  The root filesystem Go cache was full, so validation used the ignored
  repository-local `.cache/go-build`; no product behavior or tracked artifact
  depends on that cache.

## R21 — GPU metrics data-flow cleanup

Cleanup plan, based on `8b4930c` and executed regression-first:

1. [x] Lock managed implicit and explicit GPU selection plus defensive slice
   ownership at backend preparation and occurrence construction.
2. [x] Carry the effective selection through the existing run-scoped
   `PreparedBackend` seam and give every occurrence a fresh copy.
3. [x] Delete per-occurrence native YAML resolution and the ineffective
   assignment to the by-value profile copy.
4. [x] Re-audit Runner roles, validation, concrete package boundaries, and
   cleanup ownership before the standalone cleanup commit.

Audit and protected boundaries:

- `prepareBackend` was the run-scoped owner of native SGLang validation and GPU
  topology resolution, while `newSandbox` redundantly reopened and resolved the
  same native file for every occurrence. `PreparedBackend` was the existing
  narrow seam needed to reuse the result.
- `pkg/runner` still defines exactly four substitutable roles: `Benchmark`,
  `AgentHarness`, `ToolSandbox`, and `ToolBridge`. `Sandbox` remains the live
  capability returned by `ToolSandbox`; monitoring remains Recorder-owned.
- The cleanup retains explicit command switches and all strict profile,
  native-runtime topology/index, NVIDIA argv/identity/count/metric, credential,
  ownership, isolation, revocation, cleanup, and positive-absence validation.
  No registry, factory, plugin, DI layer, generic deployment abstraction, or
  dependency was added.
- `combinedResourceSource` remains live and necessary to preserve the single
  Recorder source lifecycle while sampling and closing container and GPU
  sources. No additional production deletion was reference-proven.

Implemented cleanup and pre-commit evidence:

- `PreparedBackend.EffectiveGPUIndices` owns the resolved list. Runtime
  construction receives a separate copy, and every `NewSandbox` invocation
  receives a fresh copy. Explicit configured order remains intact for
  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`; the NVIDIA source retains its existing sorted query
  and output normalization.
- `resolveRuntimeGPUIndices`, its direct test use, the second native YAML load
  and topology resolution, and the dead by-value profile assignment are gone.
  Reference checks find one `LoadNativeConfig` and one `ResolveGPUIndices`, both
  in backend preparation.
- Focused application/command, backend, configuration, monitor, and NVIDIA
  tests pass, including race tests. `git diff --check`, `go vet ./...`,
  `go list -deps ./...`, explicit-composition tests, the four-role inventory,
  and the fail-closed concrete-package direct-import graph pass.
- `make build`, `make test`, `make test-race`, and `make lint` pass. The
  deterministic integration suite reached its Docker-backed tests but could
  not access `/var/run/docker.sock` in this worker environment; it failed only
  with Docker permission-denied errors, so integration and Docker resource
  absence remain explicit environment gaps rather than claimed passes.
- Fail-closed host-process, tracked/staged/ignored key-path, and secret-shaped
  working-diff checks pass. No managed SGLang or `aries-ssh` helper process was
  found. The pre-commit status contains only the reviewed cleanup and this task
  record; generated cache/build artifacts remain ignored.

## R20 — Managed SGLang GPU selection

1. [x] Keep GPU selection inside the managed SGLang runtime configuration.
2. [x] Derive default local device indices from native parallel topology and
   reject inconsistent explicit selections before side effects.
3. [x] Share the resolved list between the child `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and the
   NVIDIA resource source without changing generic monitoring.

## R19 — Explicit NVIDIA GPU monitoring

1. [x] Reuse the existing occurrence-scoped Recorder lifecycle and
   `ResourceSource` boundary rather than adding a Runner role or independent
   telemetry lifecycle.
2. [x] Add strict explicit host-device selection for the NVIDIA source; R20
   later moved ownership of that selection to managed SGLang.
3. [x] Query selected devices through bounded exact `nvidia-smi` arguments and
   retain UUID, utilization, memory, power, and temperature in schema-version-3
   private monitor artifacts.
4. [x] Run focused, race, full release, real-GPU sampling, and cleanup checks.

Completion evidence:

- The production NVIDIA source sampled GPU0 on an H100 NVL and returned its
  stable UUID plus utilization, memory, power, and temperature.
- The production Recorder retained four real GPU samples in a private
  schema-version-3 JSONL/index pair with successful observer status.
- `make build`, `make test`, `make test-race`, `make lint`, and
  `make integration` pass. The checked-in SGLang profile setup succeeds, and
  post-suite inspection finds no ARIES-managed container or network.

## R18 — Managed SGLang shutdown and credential isolation hardening

1. [x] Keep the process-group leader unreaped through a final observer-owned
   KILL sweep, avoid duplicate KILL after successful escalation, and surface
   residual cleanup failures alongside protocol, close, and unexpected-exit
   errors.
2. [x] Let coalesced stop callers detach on their own cancellation, honor caller
   contexts during normal reap and absence confirmation, and bound forced reap
   and confirmation with one fresh five-second context.
3. [x] Remove the configured credential environment entry from the managed
   child without removing prefix-neighbor variables or the executable-first
   PATH contract.
4. [x] Expand strict native YAML boundary and checked-in configuration coverage,
   and document the graceful plus forced shutdown budgets.

Cycle-2 review evidence:

- Startup readiness retries now observe runtime exit during the injected retry
  sleep, publish the runtime's sanitized exit error, join the bounded watcher,
  and never issue another health request; deterministic and 200-iteration race
  regressions lock the handoff.
- SGLang stop results structurally distinguish an unexpected-exit-only result
  from cleanup, protocol, residual-KILL, and log-close failures without changing
  the five-method consumer interface. Application lifecycle logs therefore emit
  `unexpected_exit` plus `stopped` after a naturally exited, positively cleaned
  managed process while preserving the full joined error.
- Documentation distinguishes ARIES structured lifecycle logs, which never
  record environment values, from private child stdout/stderr, which may contain
  non-credential values emitted by the child; the configured credential is
  removed from the child environment before start.

## R17 — Post-runtime-refactor modularity audit and dead-code pruning

Cleanup plan, in evidence-first order:

1. [x] Confirm the refactor retains exactly four Runner roles, explicit command
   switches, the documented `cmd/aries -> internal/app -> pkg/runner` dependency
   direction, and the required lifecycle/isolation regressions.
2. [x] Prove every proposed deletion has no production caller, import
   obligation, or documented current contract; preserve boundary validators
   that protect configuration, ownership, credentials, isolation, or cleanup.
3. [x] Delete only the unused `pkg/model/sglang` chat request/response surface
   and its same-package tests while retaining live model discovery, bounded
   failure categories, URL handling, credential clearing, and HTTP mechanics.
4. [x] Run focused unit, race, vet, package-DAG, architecture, lifecycle, and
   diff checks, then the full release matrix and leak/process/secret checks.
5. [x] Create this audit and cleanup as a standalone commit after `62d98de`.

Initial audit evidence:

- The only references to exported `Message`, `ChatRequest`, `ChatResponse`, and
  `Client.Chat` are their declarations/implementation and same-package tests;
  no production package imports or documentation requires that API.
- `Client.Models`, `Failure` and its categories, `NormalizeBaseURL`, `New`,
  `Close`, and the shared request/response mechanics remain used by application
  preflight and must stay.
- `pkg/runner` still declares only `Benchmark`, `AgentHarness`, `ToolSandbox`,
  and `ToolBridge` as substitutable roles. `Sandbox` remains the live capability
  returned by `ToolSandbox`, not a fifth role.
- `cmd/aries/wiring.go` retains explicit switches for those four roles and the
  model backend. Application orchestration remains under `internal/app`; no
  registration, factory, plugin, reflection, or DI layer is warranted.

Rejected candidates and protected boundaries:

- Do not consolidate explicit switches or introduce a generic deployment or
  runtime registry; the direct switches are the intended extension seams.
- Do not remove or relax strict profile/backend, URL, native-runtime,
  ownership, resource, verifier-secrecy, credential, lifecycle, revocation, or
  positive-absence validation. Those checks defend runtime boundaries rather
  than merely rejecting awkward input.
- Do not prune live SGLang model discovery, failure classification, client
  credential ownership, URL normalization, or HTTP safety mechanics.
- Do not perform formatting-only movement, speculative abstraction, or add a
  dependency; no further modularity defect or dead production surface is
  evidenced.

Completion evidence:

- Removing the chat surface deleted three exported data types, one exported
  method, its two dedicated contract tests, chat-only assertions from two
  shared client tests, and the now-unused test JSON import. No production
  reference remains.
- The post-refactor anti-slop pass rejects ambiguous managed-runtime health
  URLs (including a literal trailing fragment marker), removes dead runtime,
  preflight, and test state, and directly locks health classification and
  bounds, coalesced concurrent shutdown, private/exclusive artifacts,
  partial-start cleanup, and the concrete managed-runtime application
  lifecycle.
- The follow-up ownership audit closes the exit-observation/PID-reuse signal
  window with non-reaping `waitid`, serializes TERM/KILL against observed exit,
  preserves each coalesced stop attempt's immutable result, distinguishes
  retryable per-attempt health timeouts from terminal caller cancellation, and
  removes the unused exported configuration model alias.
- The final simplification removes redundant exit-intention and observer-hook
  state, flattens the single-pass stop path, and replaces scheduler-timing
  assertions with deterministic production-attempt, signal-ownership, and
  reap barriers.
- `go list -deps ./...` and `go vet` pass across all 14 packages. The dependency
  inventory keeps concrete roles separated, with `internal/app` consuming
  `pkg/runner` and the SGLang model-discovery client while the runtime driver
  remains independent of application orchestration.
- Focused unit and race suites pass for `pkg/model/sglang`, `internal/app`,
  `internal/modelruntime/sglang`, `cmd/aries`, and `pkg/runner`, covering the
  explicit switches, runtime lifecycle, model preflight, and Runner isolation
  gates.
- After clearing the Go test cache, `make build`, `make test`,
  `make test-race`, `make lint`, and `make integration` all pass. Post-suite
  inspection finds no ARIES-managed container, network, volume, SGLang process,
  SSH helper process, staged credential, tracked key, or secret-shaped content.

## R16 — Modular managed model runtimes and normalized profiles

1. [x] Reduce `cmd/aries` to CLI process concerns and explicit constructor
   switches; move scheduling, preflight, composition, and persistence into
   `internal/app`.
2. [x] Define the consumer-owned `ModelRuntime` lifecycle/health interface and
   implement managed SGLang under `internal/modelruntime/sglang`, keeping
   inference/model discovery separate.
3. [x] Replace `sglang_file`, `model_runtime`, `model.provider`, and
   `model.model` with the clean-break `runtime.backend/mode/config` and
   `model.id/base_url/api_key_env` schema in every checked-in profile.
4. [x] Preserve the four Runner roles, positive cleanup, verifier secrecy,
   exact argv, private runtime logs, and credential handling.
5. [x] Complete the separate post-refactor extensibility/dead-code audit in its
   own commit.

## R15 — Run-scoped model runtime lifecycle

1. [x] Add strict external/managed model runtime configuration and lock invalid
   provider, executable, timeout, and SGLang-file combinations.
2. [x] Define one narrow runtime interface, retain an explicit
   provider switch, and add a managed SGLang host-process implementation with
   exact argv, private logs, idempotent process-group cleanup, and positive
   absence confirmation.
3. [x] Start the managed runtime before preflight, retry readiness within its
   startup bound, and stop it after all admitted task lifecycle work drains
   using a fresh cleanup context.
4. [x] Preserve external provider behavior, Runner's four roles, evaluation
   isolation, credential handling, and setup behavior.
5. [x] Run focused and full release validation, cancellation and leak checks,
   review the final diff, and record the original lifecycle contribution.

## R14 — Shared local SGLang configuration

- [x] Add a strict native SGLang YAML loader with focused value validation.
- [x] Let profiles reference one reusable YAML file and reject mismatched served
  model names or endpoint ports before setup or runtime side effects.
- [x] Keep remote SGLang endpoint-only operation and the four Runner roles
  unchanged; do not add server or GPU lifecycle management.
- [x] Run focused and full release validation, leak and secret checks, and
  review the final diff.
- [x] Create one concise commit when requested.

## R13 — OpenClaw 2026.7.1 explicit tag

- [x] Add an exact non-`latest` tag-only OpenClaw image validator without
  changing the Terminal-Bench task-image policy.
- [x] Store and launch `ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:2026.7.1` exactly, rejecting
  whitespace, missing tags, digests, malformed references, and `latest` at the
  configuration and harness boundaries.
- [x] Update the documented upstream baseline to tag `v2026.7.1`, commit
  `2d2ddc43d0dcf71f31283d780f9fe9ff4cc04fe4`, and its SSH compatibility
  sources.
- [x] Add regressions for the byte-exact v2026.7.1 workdir-validation,
  ensure-directory, skills-clear, and tar-upload command vectors. Synthesize
  the expected virtual cwd without a filesystem alias, drain only exact skills
  controls, preserve upload evidence, and reject virtual-namespace near matches
  before they can clear or pollute benchmark contents.
- [x] Complete the full release matrix, deterministic integration, authorized
  live DeepSeek compatibility run, retained-log audit, cleanup checks, and
  final review before release.

## R12 — Post-concurrency composition cleanup

Cleanup plan, in regression-first order:

1. [x] Retarget composition coverage to the production
   `buildTaskExperiment` path and occurrence failure coverage to the stable
   `b-002` execution identity while retaining occurrence overflow and formatting
   checks.
2. [x] Delete the test-only `buildExperiment` wrapper, remove the stored
   occurrence index, and privatize package-local experiment fields without
   changing construction, scheduling, lifecycle, cleanup, or isolation behavior.
3. [x] Make `config.ModelConfig` an alias of the identical shared
   `core.ModelConfig` and pass it directly into Runner options while preserving
   strict JSON and credential-field rejection.
4. [x] Run focused unit, race, vet, formatting, and diff checks, then the full
   release matrix and leak, process, secret, status, review, architecture, and
   adversarial-QA gates before the single cleanup commit.

Audit evidence and boundaries:

- `buildExperiment` is referenced only by its same-package composition test;
  production already constructs each occurrence through `buildTaskExperiment`.
- `taskOccurrence.index` is read only by a test; production identity and error
  reporting use the retained global counter and `executionID`.
- `experiment.Runner` and `experiment.Recorder` are package-local composition
  details, and `config.ModelConfig` duplicates `core.ModelConfig` field-for-field.
- Keep the four explicit Runner-role switches, `prepareProfile` validation
  precedence, lifecycle and isolation gates, verifier secrecy, ownership and
  cleanup checks, provider behavior, and SGLang handling unchanged. Do not add a
  registry, factory, plugin, DI layer, shared URL utility, or dependency.

## R9 — Endpoint-only SGLang provider

- [x] Require explicit `deepseek` or `sglang` model provider selection.
- [x] Add a bounded, redirect-rejecting standard-library SGLang Models and
  non-streaming Chat client with sanitized errors and optional bearer auth.
- [x] Add provider-aware preflight and OpenClaw rendering without GPU or server
  lifecycle management, plus a CPU-loadable example profile.

## R8 — Concurrent occurrences and bounded loop admission

- [x] Add strict execution configuration with default concurrency one and an
  optional positive Go-duration loop deadline.
- [x] Preserve ordered duplicates as weights and aggregate results/errors in
  deterministic global occurrence order while bounding active work.
- [x] Compose fresh one-task Runner dependencies per occurrence and use exact
  occurrence IDs for Terminal-Bench private state, artifacts, labels, monitor
  selection, and results.
- [x] Stop loop admissions at the deadline or parent cancellation, then drain
  admitted lifecycle and cleanup work.
- [x] Transfer resource-source ownership once to Recorder and close concrete
  harness/sandbox Moby clients idempotently after lifecycle cleanup.

## R7 — Whole-repository modularity audit and evidence-gated cleanup

Audit baseline: the tree immediately after `fb92446`.

Reproducible evidence:

- [x] `git ls-files | wc -l` reports 70 tracked paths;
  `git ls-files '*.go' | wc -l` reports 54 Go files; and `go list ./...`
  reports 11 packages. `go list -deps ./...` succeeds over 282 dependency
  packages with no cycle or missing package.
- [x] The internal-import edge listing from `go list -f` shows the composition
  root importing the concrete components, while component packages use shared
  core data, consumed Runner interfaces, and the narrow `containerimage`
  helper; no concrete role imports another concrete role and no fifth Runner
  role appears.
- [x] A production declaration-name inventory followed by `git grep -w`
  reverse-reference checks covered 387 distinct function, method, type,
  variable, and constant names. Every name had another tracked-Go occurrence;
  manual review of interfaces, entry points, tests, and build-tagged files found
  no demonstrably dead production symbol or file.
- [x] `go vet ./...` passes. In the restricted execution sandbox,
  `go test ./...` passed every non-bridge package and failed only nine
  listener-dependent bridge tests because `listen tcp4 127.0.0.1:0` returned
  `socket: operation not permitted`; the same command run without that socket
  restriction passes all packages.
- [x] `git ls-files | grep -v '\.go$'` reports 16 non-Go paths: seven root
  contract/build/license/task files, two configs, three docs, two Go module
  files, and two profiles. Reference and key scans tie the configs and profiles
  to loaders, tests, and runnable guidance; the docs, Makefile, ignore rules,
  module metadata, license, and agent contract are intentional repository
  surfaces rather than orphan cleanup candidates.

Architecture and regression locks:

- [x] Keep `cmd/aries.buildTaskExperiment` as the visible per-occurrence
  composition root with one
  explicit type switch per `Benchmark`, `AgentHarness`, `ToolSandbox`, and
  `ToolBridge`. `TestBuildTaskExperimentUsesExplicitTypeSwitches` locks the
  supported constructors and role-specific unsupported-type errors.
- [x] Keep the support checks in `cmd/aries.prepareProfile`.
  `TestPrepareProfileRejectsUnknownComponentsBeforeSetup` proves the entire
  setup profile is rejected before clone, task load, or image pull side effects.
  This deliberate second composition-root touchpoint preserves validation error
  precedence; it does not couple component selection into the Runner.
- [x] Keep Runner lifecycle and evaluation gates locked by
  `TestRunnerSuccessOrdering`,
  `TestRunnerIsolationFailureNeverEvaluatesEvenAfterCleanupRetry`, and
  `TestRunnerBlocksEvaluationWhenFailedHarnessStartCannotBeStopped`.
- [x] Keep bridge and harness credential/revocation checks locked by
  `TestLatePartialStartCleansListenerCredentialsAndAuditWithoutAliasBranches`,
  `TestStartFailureRemovesOnlyContainerAndClearsSecret`, and
  `TestStopFailsUntilContainerAbsenceCanBeConfirmed`.
- [x] Keep Docker identity and positive-absence checks locked by
  `TestManagerStopRejectsNilAndForeignSandbox`,
  `TestStartUsesTypedOptionsAndStopIsIdempotent`, and
  `TestExecCancellationReturnsTerminationConfirmationFailure`.
- [x] Keep strict configuration and checked resource conversion locked by
  `TestDecodeRejectsInvalidConfig`,
  `TestLoadRuntimeOverridesStrictSparseAndChecked`,
  `TestValidateEnvironmentRejectsResourceConversionOverflow`, and
  `TestHarnessRejectsInvalidResourcesBeforeContainerCreate`.
- [x] Keep verifier secrecy and task/path safety locked by
  `TestLoadFixGitMapsGenericTaskAndKeepsVerifierPrivate`,
  `TestRecursiveVerifierTreeStaysPrivateUntilEvaluate`,
  `TestPrepareSandboxRemovesThenProvesVerifierPathsAbsent`, and
  `TestNewRejectsUnsafeAndDuplicateTasks`.

Cleanup decision and ordered completion gates:

1. [x] Inventory source, dependencies, symbols, reverse references, non-Go
   surfaces, and behavior locks before proposing a source edit.
2. [x] Require focused regression evidence for every deletion or boundary
   change. No candidate met that threshold, so Task 5 remains a
   documentation-only audit result with no production or test churn.
3. [x] Run Task 5 pre-commit audit and diff checks, confirming only this R7
   record changed and no generic framework, dependency, or cosmetic churn was
   introduced.
4. [ ] Create the dedicated third change commit after `c7455eb` and `fb92446`
   with the truthful message `chore: record whole-repository cleanup audit`.
5. [ ] After all three change commits exist, run `make build`, `make test`,
   `make test-race`, `make lint`, and `make integration`; do not count the
   audit-only vet/unit evidence above as the full release gate.
6. [ ] Confirm no leaked container, network, process, staged credential, or key;
   run secret scans; verify the exact three-commit history and clean tree. Record
   these post-commit facts only in the external Ultragoal ledger/final report,
   with no fourth bookkeeping commit.

Rejected candidates and rationale:

- Removing an unreferenced-looking production declaration or file was rejected
  because the whole-repository symbol audit found no demonstrably dead one.
- Collapsing component construction into registration, factory, plugin, DI, or
  generic utility machinery was rejected because the four explicit switches
  already provide the required extension seams with less indirection.
- Deduplicating `prepareProfile` support checks was rejected because their
  preflight position prevents side effects and fixes validation error order.
- Deleting or relaxing validators was rejected where the checks defend runtime
  isolation, ownership, credentials, resource bounds, lifecycle, or cleanup.
- Pruning profiles, docs, Make targets, or ignore entries was rejected because
  the audit tied each item to an intentional user, release, or artifact surface.
- Formatting-only movement, speculative abstractions, and new dependencies were
  rejected because they add review risk without evidence of dead code or a
  modularity defect.

## R6 — Runtime isolation, sparse overrides, and raw SSH audit

- [x] Add optional dedicated strict-JSON runtime overrides with checked sparse
  CPU, memory, and agent-timeout conversion; retain an inactive one-task profile
  and apply the five-task profile's present resources to both containers.
- [x] Inject ARIES-owned task-container timezone and noninteractive environment
  values without adding environment values to lifecycle metadata.
- [x] Add benchmark-owned pre-harness removal and positive absence proof for
  verifier paths, with fresh pinned-checkout reverification and post-revocation
  verifier injection.
- [x] Retain correlated structured and exact-wire raw SSH evidence through one
  asynchronous, combined-budget, fail-closed writer.
- [x] Pass focused configuration, Runner, Docker, OpenClaw, Terminal-Bench, and
  non-listener bridge unit/race tests plus formatting and diff checks.
- [x] Complete privileged loopback SSH, Docker integration, full release, leak,
  and secret scans before the release commit.

## R5 — Live five-task reliability

- [x] Diagnose the five-task live run without treating reward `0` as an ARIES
  failure: `overfull-hbox` had bridge calls delayed up to 104 seconds and timed
  out, while `schemelike-metacircular-eval` accumulated 114–315 second calls
  before OpenClaw's 772-second stuck-session recovery triggered a takeover.
- [x] Remove sandbox-wide Docker exec serialization while retaining the
  existing token-correlated exit trailer and positive Docker process check.
- [x] Add a real concurrent SSH regression proving eight parallel tool calls,
  confirmed revocation of four active calls, and evaluator access to the
  unchanged live sandbox.
- [x] Disable OpenClaw native filesystem tools for arbitrary Terminal-Bench
  images that do not provide the helper's undeclared `python3` dependency;
  keep unmodified upstream OpenClaw and shell access through SSH exec.
- [x] Derive the run directory from the experiment profile name rather than the
  first task and task count.
- [x] Replace the stale research-oriented `AGENTS.md` with the current ARIES
  engineering, boundary, lifecycle, and verification contract.

## R4 — Repository cleanup and generic Terminal-Bench 2

Cleanup plan, in regression-first order:

1. [x] Lock current lifecycle, `fix-git`, secret handling, monitoring, and
   evaluation behavior; add dataset-backed tests for a heterogeneous five-task
   selection, recursive verifier trees, generic CTRF results, and all tasks in
   the pinned Terminal-Bench 2 revision.
2. [x] Delete linker-confirmed dead command wrappers, unreachable monitor
   artifact state, speculative `Environment.BuildDir`, redundant verifier
   snapshot machinery, obsolete prompt provenance, and empty source folders.
3. [x] Remove validations that reject legitimate inputs without protecting a
   runtime boundary: fix-git-only task values, descriptive TOML additions,
   exact CTRF test names/counts, executable-layout checks, exact `0600` secret
   mode, and uppercase-only environment names.
4. [x] Keep grounded fail-safe behavior that positively confirms container,
   process, bridge, or network cleanup. Replace the masking optional-telemetry
   string match with typed Docker not-found classification.
5. [x] Replace the single fix-git image pin with a data-only source-to-digest
   catalog covering the pinned dataset; keep task selection opaque and ordered
   in Go code.
6. [x] Load generic task resources, workdir, instruction, timeout, and complete
   private `tests/` tree; pass the task timeout through Runner to the harness;
   keep solutions private and evaluation independent.
7. [x] Add a checked-in five-task profile covering alternate workdirs,
   resources, timeout shapes, optional metadata, and nested verifier files.
8. [x] Run build, unit, race, lint, dataset, Docker integration, deterministic
   OpenClaw E2E, review, and adversarial QA; update documentation and commit a
   clean tree with no managed resources.

Fallback inventory:

- OpenClaw and Docker cleanup recovery is a grounded fail-safe because absence
  is positively confirmed and error evidence is retained; keep it.
- The bridge's two accepted OpenClaw temporary-root layouts are a narrow
  compatibility path; keep it and add the missing regression case.
- Optional telemetry's broad `"not found"` error match is masking fallback
  slop; replace it before other cleanup passes.

## R3 — Resource accuracy and replayable artifacts

- [x] Keep Docker Stats instead of adding cAdvisor; move Docker collection into
  the sandbox package behind monitor's runtime-neutral `ResourceSource`.
- [x] Derive CPU percentages from cumulative counters across samples, publish
  schema-v2 runtime fields, and add a real busy-container assertion.
- [x] Retain exact bridge argv, shell command, stdin encoding/content, duration,
  byte counts, and outcomes; do not fabricate OpenClaw tool-call IDs that never
  cross SSH.
- [x] Retain the placeholder-only rendered `openclaw.json`, use upstream
  read-write SSH workspace access, and eliminate the gateway write failure.
- [x] Use task-readable run/component paths and structured Logrus console plus
  private run-file logging.
- [x] Require Go 1.26.5 and document cross-harness bridge alternatives without
  implementing speculative adapters.
- [x] Pass build, unit, race, lint, integration, deterministic OpenClaw E2E,
  review, and adversarial QA with fresh evidence and no resource leaks.

## R2 — Lifecycle ownership, version files, and runnable documentation

- [x] Put sandbox shutdown on `ToolSandbox` while keeping the returned
  `Sandbox` limited to exec and file transfer capabilities.
- [x] Move upstream revision and image pins into strict
  `configs/versions.json`; require concrete packages to receive them through
  constructors without hardcoded fallbacks.
- [x] Move the runnable experiment into `profiles/` without adding inheritance
  or merging.
- [x] Make `aries setup PROFILE.json` prepare the exact dataset checkout and
  required images through the Moby SDK.
- [x] Add `docs/quick-start.md` and `docs/design.md`, and document why the
  SSH-to-Docker-exec bridge cannot be only a raw relay.
- [x] Treat a trusted container that exits between monitor list and inspect as
  a normal lifecycle race while preserving strict identity and label checks.
- [x] Pass the complete release checks, obtain review approval, run the
  checked-in setup path, and complete a live DeepSeek run with reward `1`, 17
  completed bridge tool records, successful monitoring, and no leaked Docker
  resources.

## R1 — Docker SDK, host SSH bridge, and simplification

User review identified three issues in the first implementation: Docker access
was unnecessarily low-level, the SSH server executed inside the task container
instead of translating requests to Docker exec, and transport-specific code and
tests obscured the design. R1 replaces that implementation without changing the
four Runner component boundaries or the independent evaluator.

- [x] Replace Docker CLI parsing and hand-written Engine HTTP in the sandbox,
  harness, and monitor with the pinned official Moby client/API modules and
  small package-private typed client subsets.
- [x] Delete the task-container exec helper, private socket/PID protocol,
  uploaded SSH server, raw Docker transport, harness initialization volume, and
  their implementation-specific lifecycle machinery.
- [x] Run the SSH listener in the host ARIES bridge and translate every accepted
  SSH exec request into `ExecStream` on the exact Docker sandbox passed to the
  bridge.
- [x] Preserve binary and late stdin, separate stdout and stderr, exact exit
  codes, atomic stream byte counts, dynamic endpoint configuration, strict
  host-key verification, and syntactically valid upstream environment names,
  including `ARIES_*`.
- [x] Run each tool command in a private process group; on cancellation use
  typed Moby detached termination plus `ContainerTop` absence proof without
  stopping, restarting, or recreating the sandbox, and propagate confirmation
  failure so the Runner blocks evaluation.
- [x] Alias OpenClaw's pinned shared workspace path for shell commands so agent
  tools and evaluation observe the same live container filesystem; disable the
  upstream Python-dependent filesystem helpers instead of translating a second
  protocol.
- [x] Retain private `<task>/bridge/tool-calls.jsonl` after bridge shutdown,
  expose it in `TaskResult`, and record replayable command/stdin inputs, byte
  counts, timing, exit code, and outcome without model credentials.
- [x] Add a fake-executor bridge contract test, a real Docker bridge mutation
  test, and a deterministic pinned-OpenClaw E2E assertion requiring completed
  bridge tool records, monitor samples for both container kinds, and reward `1`.
- [x] Remove duplicated release oracles and tests that only defended deleted
  transports; keep focused tests at component and behavior boundaries.
- [x] Keep documentation compact and current; pass `make build`, `make test`,
  `make test-race`, `make lint`, and `make integration` with reward `1`, host
  SSH tool records, cancellation without sandbox restart, both monitor kinds,
  and isolation/cleanup confirmed; report no reachable or imported
  `govulncheck` vulnerability; obtain independent code-review approval,
  architect clearance, and a 20/20 UltraQA cancellation cycle with an empty
  Docker inventory.

## MVP baseline — completed before R1

### M0 — Evidence and repository boundary

- [x] Record `aries` as the only write and Git-operation boundary.
- [x] Use `invitro` only for structure and `agent_bench` only for workflow
  archaeology; disclose the two early read-only status checks.
- [x] Pin the Terminal-Bench task/image and the upstream OpenClaw source/image.
- [x] Verify OpenClaw's SSH config, non-TTY argv, workspace formula, readiness,
  and one-turn command against the pinned source and image.

### M1 — Core Runner and configuration

- [x] Initialize the small `cmd` plus `pkg` Go layout and strict JSON
  configuration with explicit component switches.
- [x] Define direct core data and exactly four main interfaces in `pkg/runner`.
- [x] Implement ordered lifecycle, reverse cleanup, cancellation, isolation
  gates, separate outcomes, and focused fake-component tests.

### M2 — Terminal-Bench 2 adapter

- [x] Clone and verify only the pinned dataset revision.
- [x] Parse `fix-git` into generic `Task` and `Environment` values and reject
  unsupported execution-critical fields.
- [x] Keep verifier metadata private, inject tests only after isolation, run the
  verifier independently, and parse CTRF and reward artifacts.

### M3 — Local Docker sandbox

- [x] Start one labeled task container and network from the generic environment.
- [x] Implement typed exec, streaming exec, archive upload/download, log capture,
  positive inspection, idempotent cleanup, and no-leak integration coverage.

### M4 — OpenClaw SSH bridge

- [x] Implement the pinned `aries-ssh` client contract, ephemeral credentials,
  strict host verification, canonical command decoding, and cancellable sessions.
- [x] Proxy SSH exec to the same Docker sandbox, map the shared workspace,
  revoke without restarting the sandbox, and retain tool evidence.

### M5 — Upstream OpenClaw harness

- [x] Render task-local config for the remote model and upstream SSH backend.
- [x] Run one unmodified pinned OpenClaw container, await readiness, send one
  instruction, collect the response/logs/telemetry, and remove the container.
- [x] Test with a deterministic OpenAI-compatible endpoint and keep secrets out
  of Docker metadata and retained artifacts.

### M6 — Independent evaluator

- [x] Require confirmed harness stop and bridge revocation before verifier
  injection while keeping the task sandbox alive.
- [x] Preserve harness and evaluation outcomes independently and prove a valid
  sandbox is evaluated after ordinary harness failure.
- [x] Run the real pinned verifier and require the expected `fix-git` reward.

### M7 — Monitoring and end-to-end path

- [x] Compose the observer outside the Runner and record one-second CPU/memory
  samples for the task and OpenClaw containers.
- [x] Retain sandbox, harness, evaluation, monitor, result, and available
  upstream trajectory artifacts.
- [x] Add secure ignored-file DeepSeek credential loading and bounded official
  model preflight without exposing key values.
- [x] Run the complete deterministic local path and document the explicit
  one-package plus one-switch extension rule.
